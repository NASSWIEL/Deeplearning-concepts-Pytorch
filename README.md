## About DeepDiveAI

DeepDiveAI is a hands-on code examples, notebooks, and implementations of various deep learning / ML techniques. 

Training and validation curves for logistic regression on Titanic data, showing rapid convergence and strong generalization.
Model achieves high accuracy (~80%) with well-matched loss and accuracy trends across epochs.
